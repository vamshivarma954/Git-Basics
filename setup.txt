1. Create a github account first.
2. Create new repository and a file inside it and try to commit changes in github website.
3. Now to store code in github and manage it, we need to use git.
4. Setup git in local machine to make changes to remote repository using IDE
    a. Download & install git.
    b. We get gitbash installed automatically with git.
    c. Open gitbash and use below commands
         git --version          ---> To confirm git is installed or not
    d. Need to configure github account which we are trying to connect in gitbash.
           1. Go to root directory, and use below commands
                  git config --global user.name "vamshivarma954"
                  git config --global user.email "vamshivarma954@gmail.com"
                  git config --list   --> To view configured details
5. From now on, we can use vs code IDE to manage code rather than gitbash.
    1. Open a new folder and use below command to clone repository
          git clone <repo link>
    2. After successful cloning, a hidden .git file is generated inside repo folder which is a sign of git repository.
    3. After this, we can start using git commands and manage data.
           git status    ---> To check status of files comparing remote & local repos.
                               Untracked --> new file created
                               Modified, Staged, Unchanged... 
    4. Use "git init" to intialize repo from local
    5. It is recommended and easy to create repo and add initial files in the github website rather than local.
    6. git add <addname>       ----->  To add file to staging area.
    7. git add .  ----> To add all files to staging area.
    8. git commit -m "<commit message>" ----> Will add files to local repository.
    9. git push ----> Will add files from local to remote repository.
    10.Go though commands to checkout, rename branches etc.,
    11. git log ----> To show latest commmits
    12. For undoing changes
        git reset HEAD~1     ---> To undo latest commit.

        git revert <commit id>  ---> To remove that pushed changes by adding new commit for erasing
